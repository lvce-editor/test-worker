Hello from the loadFixture test!

This is a sample file created for testing the FileSystem.loadFixture functionality.
The e2e test should be able to load this fixture and verify its content in the editor.

Features being tested:
- FileSystem.loadFixture with single parameter (url)
- Opening files in the editor
- Verifying file content

This demonstrates that the type generation fix is working correctly.
